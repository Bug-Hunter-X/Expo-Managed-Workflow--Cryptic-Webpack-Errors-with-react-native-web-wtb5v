While developing an Expo managed workflow app, I encountered an unusual error related to the interaction between the `react-native-web` library and the Expo CLI's handling of Webpack.  Specifically, when attempting to use a component library or custom component that relied on certain Webpack features (like dynamic imports or specific loaders), the Expo development server would fail to start or display a cryptic error message, rather than a helpful indication of the Webpack configuration conflict.

The problem was not immediately apparent from the standard error messages.  It was only through careful examination of the Webpack output in the Expo development server logs (which can be verbose), that I identified inconsistencies or conflicts between the Webpack configuration implied by Expo and that needed by `react-native-web` and my components.
